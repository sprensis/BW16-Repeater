- BLE configuration: read/write SSID/password/mode
- STA+AP: concurrent operation, reconnect on loss
- NAT: clients receive IP, Internet access, ping/HTTP
- Bridge: clients visible in main subnet, IP from upstream router
- Web UI: authentication, status, change settings, view logs
- Watchdog: recovery after hang
